### 📅 Day 2.2 — React Router & Context API

### 15 Days of React Challenge
### 
📌 What I Learned Today

On Day 2.2, I focused on two of the most important concepts in modern React:

React Router DOM – for page navigation

Context API – for global state management

I didn’t just study them — I implemented and practiced them through hands-on projects to understand how they work in real applications.

### 🚀 Topics Covered
### 1️⃣ React Router DOM

React Router helps in building multi-page experiences inside a single-page application.

I learned how to:

Install and configure React Router

Use <BrowserRouter>, <Routes>, and <Route>

Create multiple pages like:

Home

About

Contact

Services

Account

Not Found (404)

Navigate between pages without reloading

### 📌 This made my React app behave like a real website.

### 2️⃣ Context API

Context API helps in sharing data across components without prop drilling.

I practiced:

Creating a Context using createContext()

Creating a Provider component

Wrapping my app with the Provider

Accessing data using useContext()

I stored user data like:

Name

Email

City

Age

and accessed it in multiple components easily.

### 🛠 What I Built

### To practice these concepts, I created:

### 🔹 React Router Mini Project

A multi-page React app with:

Home

About

Contact

Services

Account

404 Page

### 🔹 Context API Practice App

A user data provider that shares data globally across components using Context API.

### 🎯 Why This Day Was Important

Today helped me understand:

How large apps manage navigation

How apps share global data like user info, theme, authentication, etc.

How professional React projects are structured

This day connected many real-world React concepts together.
