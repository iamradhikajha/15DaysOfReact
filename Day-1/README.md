### Day 1 – React Fundamentals & Setup

Today I started my **15 Days React Learning Challenge**, where I aim to master React by building concepts step-by-step.
Day 1 was all about understanding **what React is, how it works, and setting up a strong foundation**.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ What is React & Why React?
React is a JavaScript library used to build fast and interactive user interfaces.
It helps in creating reusable UI components and makes complex UI easy to manage.

---

### 2️⃣ ReactDOM
ReactDOM is responsible for rendering React components into the browser DOM.
It connects React with the actual web page.

---

### 3️⃣ Installing React (Vite Boilerplate)
Vite is a fast tool used to create and run React projects.
It gives a ready-made project structure with modern setup and fast loading.

---

### 4️⃣ Import & Export
Import and export are used to share components, functions, or variables between files.
They help in organizing code into multiple reusable files.

---

### 5️⃣ React Folder Structure
React projects are divided into folders like `src`, `components`, and `public`.
This structure keeps the code clean, readable, and easy to maintain.

---

### 6️⃣ JSX
JSX allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript.
It makes UI code simple and more readable.

---

### 7️⃣ Real DOM vs Virtual DOM
The Real DOM updates the entire page when a change happens.
The Virtual DOM updates only the changed part, making React faster.

---

### 8️⃣ useState Hook
`useState` is used to store and update data inside a component.
It allows React components to be dynamic and interactive.

---

### 9️⃣ Adding CSS in React
CSS can be added using external files or inline styles.
It helps in designing and styling React components.

---

### 🔟 Calling Functions in React
Functions are called using event handlers like `onClick`.
They help in responding to user actions such as clicking a button.

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Form Handling in React
Form handling is done by storing input values in state.
It allows React to control and validate user input.
Use of e.preventDefault()
