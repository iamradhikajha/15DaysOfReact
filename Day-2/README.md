### 🚀 #15DaysOfReact
### 📅 Day 2 – Axios & API Integration

Today I continued my 15 Days of React Learning Challenge, and Day 2 was focused on learning how to connect a React application with a backend API using Axios.
I learned how real-world applications fetch data from servers and display it dynamically on the frontend.

### 📌 Topics Covered
### 1️⃣ What is Axios & Why Axios?

Axios is a JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js.
It helps React applications communicate with backend servers and APIs easily.

### 2️⃣ Axios vs Fetch

Axios is easier to use than the Fetch API.
It automatically converts data to JSON, handles errors better, and has cleaner syntax.

### 3️⃣ Installing Axios

Axios is installed using npm and added to the React project so it can be used for making API calls.

### 4️⃣ Making GET Requests

Using Axios, we can send a GET request to a backend or public API to fetch data.

### 5️⃣ useState with Axios

The useState hook is used to store the data received from the API.
This allows React to update the UI whenever new data is fetched.

### 6️⃣ Asynchronous API Calls

Axios works asynchronously, meaning the app does not freeze while waiting for data from the server.

### 7️⃣ Rendering API Data in UI

The data received from the API is displayed on the screen using .map() inside JSX.

### 8️⃣ Button-Based Data Fetching

A button click triggers the Axios request, allowing the user to fetch data when needed.

### 9️⃣ Connecting Frontend with Backend

Axios acts as a bridge between the React frontend and the backend API.

### 🔟 Handling API Response

The response returned by Axios contains the actual data, which is then stored and used in the app.

### 🧪 Practice & Mini Project

I created a small React project where:

A button sends an Axios request

Data is fetched from an API

The data is stored using useState

The fetched data is displayed on the screen

This project helped me understand how real-world applications connect frontend with backend.
